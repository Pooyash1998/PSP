## Praktikum System Programmierung
This is a sample project for the "Praktikum System Programmierung" course at RWTH Aachen University. The project involves developing an operating system for an ATmega644 microcontroller in C/C++.

The operating system will include a kernel, device drivers, and support for managing hardware resources, memory, and processing tasks. The project will be hosted on GitLab, where we will use version control, issue tracking, and continuous integration to manage and test our codebase.
